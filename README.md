# Mithrandir
This is a simple small package manager called Mithrandir.
This package manager is nothing much of big but i think it has something special on it.It is very customizable.
On the recipe.json you can choose the programs the package manager will execute to install certain packages.This allows the package manager to install binaries, compile from source ,install other files like .deb,.rpm etc.But this works in theory.It may not be very practical, but it is very usefull if you want to learn Linux.
If you are a begginer don't install Mithrandir,just like Gandalf, Mithrandir is powerfull but can be defeated by a Balrog on your PC.

I hope you like it.
